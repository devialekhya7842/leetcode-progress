Given the head of a Singly Linked List and a number k, the task is to find the data of the modular node of the linked list. If no such index is present return -1.

A modular node is defined as the last node in the linked list whose index is divisible by k (i%k==0). 

Note: 1-based indexing is followed

code:
'''
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):   # data -> value stored in node
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
'''
class Solution:
    def modularNode(self, head, k):
        # Code Here
        l=-1
        i=0
        if head ==None:
            return 
        temp=head
        while (temp != None):
            i+=1
            if i % k == 0:
                l=temp.data
                temp=temp.next
            else:
                temp=temp.next
        return l
